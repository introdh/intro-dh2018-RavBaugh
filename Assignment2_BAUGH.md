**Assignment 2: Network of American Studies Program**

---------------------------------------------------------

***Introduction***


What are the components of the American Studies program at the University of Richmond? Why is it called ‘Studies’ rather than a more specific subject area? Who are the core faculty for the American Studies program? These are some of many questions I considered before building my network assignment. M. E. J. Newman states that “a network is, in its simplest form, a collection of points joined together in pairs by lines” (Newman-*Networks: An Introduction*- 2010). These lines create interlocking systems that map interdependency and relationships (Weingart-JDH-2011).This is helpful to display relationships between subjects and to convey patterns of connection between various items. For networks, the subjects are the nodes and the connections are the edges that together create a larger interlocking system (Newman-*Networks: An Introduction*- 2010). 


***Process***


Firstly, I want to address why I selected this network and then explain my process for collecting data. I decided to create a network on American Studies as I wanted more insight on the connections between individuals, gender, and subjects that make up the interdisciplinary program. This would also reveal how diverse, in regards to subject matter and gender, that the program is. I selected my data from the University of Richmond’s bannerweb site. There, I went into the class listings for American Studies from Fall 2015 to Spring 2019. This gave me four academic years of data to create my network. This time frame allowed for more subjects and professors to be listed that taught in this program. 

 I decided to select the professors and the attributes from each course listing. I did this because it is important to consider the professors teaching the courses as each professor has a different expertise or specialized knowledge that can be applied to a class. As for attributes, attribution is the method that the university uses to assign four letter identifiers to courses to readily conveywhat subjects or programs are within a course. This network only contains attribution that relates directly to a subject such as “ENEL” that is short for “English elective.” This aids the network in displaying subject connections, professors' connections to subjects, and the meaning of these attributions for American Studies. After gather this information, the professors and attributions were added into a spreadsheet titled edges to be imported into RStudio.
 
Following this, I went to the university’s directory and gathered information on each professor that I came across for that time period. I gathered their names, listed titles, type of professorship, and gender. Like the professors and attributions, this data was added into a spreadsheet titled nodes along with individual labels of attributes. This aided in creating additional networks that aided in further answering my questions on professorship and gender dynamics in the program.  

***Findings and Results***


The network contained 13 professors (list them) 
21 individual attributes (list them) - note that some where more frequently listed in courses such as WGSS and THEL (maybe later in findings) 
There were various titles for professors with some choosing to not have a title but only affiliation to a subject 
3 types and 2 listings of non professorship were found (professor, associate, assistant, not saying) - talk abut how 5 and 5 are associate or full prof. Only 1 assistant. 2 not listed.  (no adjucts though richmond does have adjuct professors such as in the journalism department and no visiting professors though ur has some like in the german and political science department ) 
3 genders were represented (she, he, they) - more female then male professors and only one that identified as both male and female (so outside binary). 
These initially showed interactions and what that does but further looking at the graphs reveals the greater implications of the major. We will look at degree, eigen, close, between, cluster, component, component size, gender pronouns, type of prof and title, and type of professor.
