**Assignment 1: Topic Model of Poetry**

----------------------------------------------

***Introduction***


How can poetry express historical influences? If it can, what are these influences and how can they be identified? These are two of the questions I pondered before beginning my topic modeling assignment. According to Megan R. Brett, topic modeling " is a form of text mining, a way of identifying patterns in a corpus. You take your corpus and run it through a tool which groups words across the corpus into ‘topics’”(Brett, JDH, 2012). In essence, Topic modeling can aid in finding patterns between different words and displaying these in groups. This is helpful for large corpuses of data that cannot otherwise be grouped into topics as quickly. 

I decided to select a poetry journal as poetry is a form of self-expression. I wanted to see what trends, ideas, and historical patterns were prevalent in these works. *The American Poetry Review* has a vast and diverse amount of works that span over many years; this made it a prime selection to topic model. *The American Poetry Review* selects prominent American poetry and, unlike other journals, prints these poems into its pages. The journal also contains a small number of articles that analyze poetry; however, the number of poems outways this significantly. In total, my corpus contains over 50,000 items spanning from 1972 to 2014. By selecting this size and type of corpus, I was able to receive a wide range of American poetry over the span of many decades. This would more readily allow me to see trends as well as historical influences from various works. 

***Process***



Before discussing my initial findings, it is important to address the process and decisions I made while handling my data. One decision I made was to use all of the data available on JSTOR to build my topic model. I did this so that I could see trends over time, trends across times, and not have my data only on specific decades. For example, I could have selected data from only the 2010, 2011, 2012, and 2014. Then I could have used this data to create a topic model and see what trends would appear. While I would see trends that correlate with that time like "technology" or "advancement." I would not have the same varied historical trends I receive from using a larger sample.

 Another decision I made was to have thirty topics. This happened after trying different topic sizes and deciding which size had the most related and most varied groups. Initially, I created one hundred topics due to having a large corpus of data. While there were some specific topics such as weather and poets, many of the topics seemed to cross over. For example, a list with words such as “sun” and “snow” and another list with “rain” and “trees” were in different topics. These words could fit in a topic together called “Seasons” or “Growth." This happened when I used smaller topic sizes. By shrinking to thirty topics, I was able to see more defined groups that correlated together without having two or three topics in one area. 
 
 ***Findings and Results***
 
 
As stated, I created thirty topics. Each topic had eight words each. The topics were as follows: American Poets, Birds, Cars, Civil War, College, Decay, Family, Forgotten, Informed, Journal Location, Local Location, Mafia, Modes of Writing, Ocean, Pirates, Poetry’s Uses, Printing, Publishing, Race, Reading, Recognition, Seasons, Senses, Spiritual, Surrealism, Syntax, Transcendentalism, Translation, Want, and Worship. I selected these titles for the topics to correspond with the meaning or group meaning of the words collected by the program MALLET. Some of the key topics that aided in answering my initial questions were “Civil War,” “Transcendentalism,” “Surrealism,” “Translation,” and “Forgotten.” These topics address how history has influenced works as well as how poetic language reveals emotions towards the past. 

To begin, the topic “Civil War” contains words such as “black,” “people,” and “war.” Topic modeling tracks the frequency of words appearing next to or with one another. Due to this, it was the combination of these type of words that made me conclude that this topic centered on the Civil War. The Civil War did not occur between 1972 and 2014; however, the legacy of the war has a large impact on poetry. This topic combined with other topics such as "Race" show that the racial tensions in the country influence poets language and interests. 

The topic “Transcendentalism” contains words such as “whitman,” “life,” and “time.” The Transcendentalism period focused on humanity and nature. One of the key writers of the movement was Walt Whitman. Though the movement happened earlier, the fact that the corpus recognized his name associated with words like “life” and “time” indicates that it is talking about elements of his writing. By looking at this topic and other topics like "Seasons" and "Decay," the influence of key Transcendentalism sections are reflected in these works. This shows that relevence of nature, humanity, and life are more fluid then literary movements have them listed. 

The next category follows a similar thought process. The topic “Surrealism” has words such as “ashbery,” “art,” and “painting.” Like Walt Whitman with Transcendentalism, John Ashbery was a prominent poet during the Surrealism literary period. The Surrealism period focused on the impact of artwork, paintings, and drawing away from realistic depictions. This points to these elements influencing poetry of the 1970’s and beyond through the use of word choice. There are also topics that address the concepts of past and time without directly connecting to a time period. For example the topic “Forgotten” which has the words “lost,” “memory,” and “past.” This topic conveys that many poets are reaching into the past and into memories (whether theirs or historical) to create notable works on issues like race, life, spirituality, and self. 

Adding to this, the topic model revealed another part of historical context: language. The topic “Translation” shows that American poetry has outside influences. This can be obvious when the program associated the word “Translation” with “german.” This shows that there is german influence and likely german words that are used in the poetry. However, the group also has the word “la” which is Spanish for “the.” This connects the Spanish language to translating the poetry as well as how the poetry may have been written prior to being published in this journal. This reveals two things: global origins of now american labeled poetry or multicultural representation in some of the poetry. 

***Limitations and Possibilities*** 

The final points I will address are the limitations of topic modeling, the program used, and my own abilities. Firstly, there are short falls of topic modeling. Directly concerning poetry, Lisa Rhody highlights why figurative language can be an issue for topic modeling. She writes that the topics' forms involve a “diminishing of language’s possible meanings” (Rhody, JDH, 2012).  She then concludes that topic modeling may defeat the purpose of works like poetry by categorizing words that may be intended to be used in a different fashion (Rhody, JDH, 2012). This means that the topics that I have produced may contradict the intentions of the poets’ works. For example, metaphors compare two not similar objects to give a deeper understanding to the reader; however, topic modeling might group these objects into one category. This can lead to incorrect assumptions being made about the vast amount of works because neither I nor MALLET have the correct context.  Other limitations come from lack of time and skill. I do not have time to analyze over 50,000 works. Even if I could, I do not have the skills of interpretation, close reading, and close studies on historical backgrounds, to understand each author's intentions. A possiblity to work with this is to run the program with more or less topics are track where the program separates the words. This can aid in seeing on a smaller scale how the program is associating terms. I can also re-run the program for different iterations of the topic model and see what words stay in place. However,this can still be inaccurate and have differences in comparison to someone reading the texts. This plight is highlighted by Cameron Blevins with Martha Ballard’s Diary where he has a different number of topics and slightly different information then the close reading. However, like Blevins brings up, the topic modeling can highlight overlooked word choices as well as patterns that the human mind may not recognize (Blevins, personal blog, 09-09-2009). Therefore, even with these limitations, the topic model method is helpful for interpreting or analyzing large corpuses.
