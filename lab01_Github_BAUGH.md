# Questions 
*1. What are you most nervous about this semester?*

* I am nervous about balancing this with my other classes. This class and many of my others are reading and writing heavy.
 
*2. What you you most excited about this semester?*

* I am excited to figure out what Digital Humanities is and how to use it in the humanities field. I think this will help me with research ideas as well as understanding archival work in the modern age.

*3. Why did you choose to take this course?*

* I took the class for several reasons. One, I wanted to take another American Studies course as well as a WGSS course. Two, I loved being in your class last year and remember you advertising this one. Finally, it worked with my schedule where other classes did not (the issues of taking five classes). 

# Digital

* Two pieces of digital content I interacted with over the summer was a video of Markiplier (a famous gamer youtuber) titled "Let's Be Completely Honest" and a picture in the news of a Milan immigrant in France who saved a child that was falling from a building. The first video was memorable because Mark spoke about issues of feeling inadequate while being in a good place in life, talked about being frustrated and finding strength to do what he wants rather than what it seems is the right thing, and several other issues like burnout. This spoke to me because I felt this way last year and was trying to find pieces that spoke to me and made me feel like it wasn't just all in my head. The photograph stood out to me because it was good news and it showed immigration in a positive light. The Milan was given expedited citizenship processing and several interviews about his story. He physcially climbed to save the child who had already fallen a few flights of the building.
