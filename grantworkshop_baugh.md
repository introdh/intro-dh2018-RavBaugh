**Grant Workshop: Visualization of Human Trafficking**

----------------------------------------------

***Guiding Questions***

  * Where is most of the human trafficking in the United States taking place?
  * What countries are the major sources of human trafficking to the United States?
  * What job or professional sectors (or markets) commonly draw from human trafficking victims?
  * Where are these sectors (or markets) located in the United States?
  * What regions have prominent human trafficking from certain sectors (or markets)? 
  * Why these sectors over others (driving forces)? 

***Abstract***

This project will map the countries that export the most human trafficked individuals to the United States. After identifying these countries, the map will direct to specific regions of the United States. These regions will also be identified with sectors or markets that that region has the most human trafficked individuals working in. The project will also feature reasons for these specific regions, countries, and sectors (driving forces) perpetuate human trafficking in the United States. This project will primarily use Spatial Analysis and GIS mapping. This method is best as it will display a map where specific locations can be listed and detailed. It can also aid in time lapse over regions of the United States to show trends of trafficking. Finally, it will best connect the other countries to the United States in a visual way that networking or topic modeling cannot. Adding, the project will also feature networks of major sectors to other countries (on a different page than the greater map) to easily identify the connection between the two. The same will be done with United States regions. This will be different from the GIS mapping as it will show the linked connection and identify, without the use of maps, what sectors in specific regions traffic individuals. The project will cross into the Global Studies, American Studies, Political Science, History, and Geography disciplines due to its concerns with space, the United States, global trends, and human trafficking. Using these methods and disciplines, the project will show the common forms for entrapment, driving forces for entrapment, and location of migration in the United States in a readily visual display.
