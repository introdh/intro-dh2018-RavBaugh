  * Where are these sectors located in the United States?

***Abstract***

(2) Provide a one-paragraph abstract written for a nonspecialist audience, clearly explaining the projectâ€™s principal activities and its expected results.

The characterstics of a strong abstract:

explains the humanities question(s) guiding the project
includes the DH methods that will be used and why
identifies which humanities fields/ disciplines the project is engaged in

I want to create a project that maps the relationship of immigrant, migrant, or refugee movement to the United States to the reports of (or increases of) modern day slavery forms such as through prostitution, housekeeping, or other major sectors. I want to build a network that shows where the migrants are going on a map (in the united states) and what are the common forms of entrapment in those areas. I will be using a network or multiple networks for this NEH grant.
