# Introduction

What can mapping tell me about myself? What are my spaces and places on campus? How do spaces change how I interact with places? These are a few of the questions I pondered before beginning my GIS (geographic information system) mapping assignment. According to Jaime Martindale, GIS data is “ a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of geographical data” (Martindale, UW Madison Libraries, no date). GIS is a tool that allows for individuals to define space and place through digital mapping. This aids in spatial analysis as geographic based information is spatial (Martindale, UW Madison Libraries, no date). By using GIS, I was able to identify a week’s worth of locations that revealed how I interact with my environment. This week had more places and different spaces than my usual routine. 

# Process 

For the assignment, I was tasked with tracking my hourly movements around campus for the week of November 5th, 2018. In the data’s entirety, it begins November 5th at 12:00 am (0:00 military time) until November 12th at 12:00 pm (23:00 military time). As I do not live my life in perfect hour intervals, I selected where I spent the majority of each hour block. This also excluded smaller events that did not meet at least a thirty minute threshold. I detailed each activity, the hour, location, coordinates, and (later) mapping categories. This information was uploaded in ArcGis and then sent to a StoryMap. 
The activities were as follows: Break, Buying Stuff, Class, Cleaning Room, Contested Spaces Journalism, Dinner, Eating, English Class, ESL tutoring, German Class, German Lecture, German Training, Helping Someone, Homework, Journalism Class, Lunch, MOVE, Meetings, Sick, Sleep, SSIR, Voting, and Work. There were also split activity labels such as Lunch and Homework if the time was equally dedicated to two or more activities. These worked as quick labels; however, I learned that I needed more uniform labels for categorizing in ArcGis. The coordinates were taken from google maps; this is a site that has geographical locations down to specific coordinates of many places on Earth. I selected a place on each location that most accurately represented where I was in the building during the time of the activity. As for mapping categories, these were created last. I edited and reuploaded my dataset to reflect these points after visually realizing (through GIS) that my points seemed disconnected. The program would gray-out many points and not draw connections between spaces that were used similarly such as those for classes. That is why I created new labels to have uniform coloring and to organize my StoryMap in a cohesive manner focused on my week. 

After creating the data set, I uploaded the data to ArcGIS as a .csv file. I first used the map tool on the site and added my data as a layer. I then selected a map that identifies roadways and buildings through outlined shapes rather than satellite pictures. I did this so that the map would clearly show the coloring of the categories. It also made it easier to see larger regions of the campus as well as visibly see the labeling of buildings than other maps. This was important for my dataset as I was contained on the campus; however, I had locations across campus. I then used the same site to create a story map. 

My story map had a left side panel in order for viewers to see the many links and the entirety of the map I wanted to display. I selected the color black to contrast the lighter map making the map more striking to the viewer. I grouped my narrative by the mapping categories: Dorm Life, Work Life, Classes, Lunch, Dinner, Homework, Volunteering, Interested Events, and Random Short Experiences. As I wanted to make direct connections to space, I included multiple images of my classmates or individuals I meet during the week. David Bodenhamer said that spaces “ reflect the values and cultural codes present in the various political and social arrangements that provide structure to society” (Bodenhamer, History and GIS: Epistomologies, Considerations and Reflections, 2013). My StoryMap analyzes how I feel in each space that I interacted with during the week. I utilize the Story Action features of ArcGis to show the viewer where my spaces are typically compared to this week. I also use the feature to take the view to each location in the context of the categories. For example, my German class was in Whitehurst; however, it is usually in Puryear hall. This is marked by a Story Map feature to easily display the difference. The information then details that as I moved to a new place on campus, the space (in this case social arrangements) also changed as I was speaking with a Visiting German Professor. I also made sure to have an introduction and conclusion to guide the narrative of the StoryMap. These indicate the differences of my week and why that is important for my space and place on campus.
