# Introduction

What can mapping tell me about myself? What are my spaces and places on campus? How do spaces change how I interact with places? These are a few of the questions I pondered before beginning my GIS (geographic information system) mapping assignment. According to Jaime Martindale, GIS data is “ a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of geographical data” (Martindale, UW Madison Libraries, no date). GIS is a tool that allows for individuals to define space and place through digital mapping. This aids in spatial analysis as geographic based information is spatial (Martindale, UW Madison Libraries, no date). By using GIS, I was able to identify a week’s worth of locations that revealed how I interact with my environment. This week had more places and different spaces than my usual routine.
